We strive to complete the assigned tasks to the best of our abilities. We all share the same goal of learning as much as we can, and creating a beautiful piece of work for a portfolio at the same time. In hopes of creating an effective, fair, and fun group we should all follow the following rules:
- We will do our best to complete our fair share of work.
- We will respect that we all come from different backgrounds and have different strengths and weaknesses.
- We will help our teammates out when needed.
- We will make an effort to teach one another.
- We will respect differences of opinion and settle any disputes in a democratic manner
- We will treat each other, the instructors, and TAâ€™s with respect.
- We will attend the team meetings.
- We will meet our individual deadlines as determined by the team.
- We will stay in communication through slack, with an expectation to respond to questions within 24 hours.

### In cases of a transgression
If a member of the group has crossed any lines or broken any of these rules, we should follow these steps:
1. Alert the group member of their transgression one on one.
2. If the problem involves multiple people, discuss it as a group.
3. If steps 1 and 2 are not sufficient, we should share the transgression with an instructor or staff member and ask them for guidance.
